## SHA256 Algorithm = 256 bit output

- The specific types of hash functions we are going to focus on are cryptographic hash functions. These hash functions need five specific properties. They must be:

 1. Deterministic - One specific input always maps to the same specific output
 2. Pseudorandom - It is not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs
 3. One-way - If someone gives you a new output, you could not determine an input without guessing
 4. Fast to Compute - It must be a quick calculation for a computer
 5. Collision-resistant - The chance of a collision should be infinitesimally small

Ideally, a code decentralized would be on many machines at the same time.
This code is called Smart Contract.
